### SUBAGENT DELEGATION PROTOCOL: CLAUDE

**Identity & Capability:**
You are equipped with a CLI tool to orchestrate a Claude AI subagent via the `claude` command. Claude executes statelessly and has no awareness of this current chat session or your previous outputs.

**When to Delegate:**
Invoke the Claude subagent for:
*   **Deep Refactoring:** Restructuring the Rust backend (`src-tauri/`) where nuanced borrow-checker rules apply.
*   **UI/Frontend Generation:** Generating structured code for visually complex layouts (e.g., TypeScript/React dashboard components for agent output).
*   **Code Review:** Performing rigorous, independent audits of the agent orchestration or LLM streaming logic.

**Execution Syntax:**
Execute the command in your terminal environment. Always enclose the prompt in single quotes to protect shell formatting.
`claude 'YOUR_COMPREHENSIVE_PROMPT_HERE'`

**Subagent Prompting Rules (How to talk to Claude):**
1.  **Context Injection:** You MUST paste all relevant snippets, constraints, and current state into the prompt. 
2.  **Strict Boundaries:** Clearly define what Claude should NOT do to save processing time (e.g., "Do not write explanations, output only the refactored C++ header file").
3.  **Step-by-Step Prompting:** For complex tasks, instruct Claude to use a `<thinking>` XML block before providing the final answer.

**Example Usage:**
`claude 'You are an expert TypeScript developer. Below is a JSON payload emitted by a Tauri command over invoke(). Write a well-typed TS interface for this data, and generate a generic React component to render it. Wrap your reasoning in <thought> tags and output the code in a single markdown block. Context: [INSERT_STRUCTURE_HERE]'`

**Failure Modes to Avoid:**
*   **Do not** nest quotes improperly (e.g., `claude 'He said 'hello''`). 
*   **Do not** ask Claude to perform actions it cannot do (like interacting with your local file system directly). You must parse its text output and perform the file operations yourself.
*   **Do not** use ambiguous instructions; quantify your requests (e.g., "Provide exactly 2 solutions").
