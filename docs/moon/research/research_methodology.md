# Research Methodology & Guidelines

Guidelines and protocols for conducting technical research, architectural spikes, and feasibility assessments.

## Overview

In this project, research is a collaborative effort to explore new tools, evaluate design decisions, and prototype capabilities before they are formally adopted into the core modules. This document outlines our standard research methodology to ensure that findings are structured, reproducible, and aligned with our system design principles.

## 1. Initiating Research

Research is typically initiated via a GitHub/Forgejo issue labeled with `type/research` or `type/spike`. Before starting:
1. Create a dedicated feature branch named `research/<issue-number>-<short-description>`.
2. Define clear boundaries to avoid "scope creep". A research spike should have a fixed duration (usually 2-5 days).

## 2. Research Steps

### Phase 1: Literature & Ecosystem Review
Explore existing open-source solutions, libraries, and design patterns. Document options in the research note.

### Phase 2: Prototyping (Spikes)
Build a minimalist proof-of-concept. Experimental code should:
- Live in the relevant directory (`src/`, `src-tauri/`, `android/`) but be clearly isolated (e.g. in a `spike/` or `experimental/` package).
- Avoid changing existing production code interfaces unless absolutely necessary.
- Not require extensive test suites, but should include a simple driver script to demonstrate functionality.

### Phase 3: Evaluation
Benchmark performance, analyze dependency overhead, assess security implications, and evaluate developer experience.

## 3. Documenting Findings

Upon completion, the researcher must compile findings into a research note under `docs/moon/research/` utilizing the `TEMPLATE.md` structure. The research note must be committed to the branch, and a Pull Request opened for review.
Once the PR is approved and merged, the decisions made should be codified in an [Architectural Decision Record (ADR)](../adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md) if they alter the project's long-term structure or technologies.
